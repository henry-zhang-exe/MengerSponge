We have successfully generated the menger cube! It is a little jank at the moment, but we will move onto the
next portion of the assignment. Next up, we will begin keyboard and mouse support for both camera movement and
menger cube generation. We are making good progress, and we will continue at our current (intense) rate in 
order to finish the project on time.
